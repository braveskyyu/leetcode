Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

这题最开始想在一个loop中同时找到最大值和最小值，但是发现很难保证最大值一定在最小值后边，看了答案，解法如下，先找最小值，然后找当前值和最小值之前的最大差值，由于最小值是可能变的，但只要保证差值最大就切题了。profit = Math.max(prices[i]-min, profit);

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) 
    {
        if (prices==null || prices.length==0 || prices.length==1) return 0;        
        int min=prices[0];
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i=1;i<prices.length;i++)
        {
            if (prices[i]<min) min = prices[i];
            profit = Math.max(prices[i]-min, profit);
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
