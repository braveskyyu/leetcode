Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]<br>
Output: 7<br>
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.<br>
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.<br>
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

这题还是比较简单，发现只要算”连续“ 的profit就可以了，而不需要比较，比如:<br>
[1，1，5，3，6，7], 只要算5-1，6-3，7-6 的和相加，这样一定是最大profit，而不需要再和7-1(最大值减最小值)去比较。这题做的比较爽，<br><b>一次过</b>b>
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices==null || prices.length==0 || prices.length==1) return 0;        
        int profit=0;
        int num=prices[0];        
        for (int i=1;i<prices.length;i++)
        {
            if (prices[i]-num>0)
            {
                profit = profit+prices[i]-num;                
            }
            num = prices[i];
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
