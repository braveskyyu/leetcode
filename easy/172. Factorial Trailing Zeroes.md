这个题挺有意思，给定一个整数，计算它阶乘后的数尾数有几个0。最开始的想法是算出阶乘后的数，然后数有几个0，后来发现不行，可能会溢出，又仔细想了想，这样的数有一个特征，就是能够被5整除，如果可以被5整除的话，就count++，但是后来发现，比如25这种数字，可以被5整除2次，所以应该count+2，
基于这个算法给出了solution，后来发现还是不行，因为假如这个数非常大的话，每次n--，遍历所有的n，也会造成很慢，想了一下，干脆判断n能否被5整除，如果不能的话，就n--，直到能的话，那么就n=n-5，这样终于得出了下面的方法。

```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        if (n<=4) return 0;        
        int m=0;
        int tmp=n;
        while(n>4)
        {
            if (n%5==0)
            {
                m++;
                tmp=n/5;
                while(tmp>4)
                {
                    if (tmp%5==0) 
                    {
                        m++;
                        tmp=tmp/5;
                    }                        
                    else
                        break;                                        
                }
                n=n-5;
            }
            else                
                n=n-1;
        }
        
        return m;
    }
}
```

可是这样算出的结果还是很慢，因为n太大了，理论上n可以等于Integer.MAX_VALUE,

看了高赞答案，另一种做法是看给定数n里包含多少个5，n/5，但这样还不够，因为比如25，125，625
这样的数字里，还隐藏另一些5，所以还需要加上隐藏的5，举例来说比如n=125，首先看125里包含多少个5，(对应5,10,15,20....125)，然后需要找125里包含多少个25(25,50,75,100,125)，虽然25里有2个5，但是第一个5已经被包含在前面的算式里了，所以这一轮只要看125里有几个25就好,最后还有看125里有多少个5的三次冥，也就是125/125，所以是125/5+125/25+125/125

详细解释如下:

Here's a good explanation:<br>
If we knew how many times we could divide n! by 10 without causing it to no longer be an integer, we would have our answer. For example, if n! equaled 3628800, we could divide it by 10 twice and the result would still be an integer. This is because there are two trailing zeroes. The number of times we can divide an integer by 10 before it is no longer an integer can be referred to as the number of factors of 10 in the integer.

10's prime factors are 5 and 2. No two other prime numbers multiply to equal 10 (if you don't believe this, try now to find two other prime numbers that multiply to equal 10). The above means that for every factor of 10 that can be found in a number, there is exactly one factor of 5 and one factor of 2. In other words, one factor of 5 and one factor of 2 in an integer mean the integer has one factor of 10. And the number of factors of 10 in n! is the answer we're looking for.

So, if we can figure out the lesser of how many 5s and how many 2s are hiding within the sequence of numbemrs being multiplied together in the calculation for n!, we will know how many 10s are hiding there - and we will have our answer (see above if you don't understand why).

Every other number (i.e. every even number) in the calculation for n! will have at least one factor of 2, so the number of factors of 2 will far exceed the number of factors of 5. Because we're looking for the lesser of the two, we can just focus on finding the number of factors of 5.

All multiples of 5 have at least one factor of 5. Powers of 5, as in 5^2 or 5^3, have more than one factor of 5, so those needs to be counted more than once. More on that later.

The equation for calculating the number of multiples of 5 within n! is n / 5. For example, 10! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10. Did you spot the multiples of 5? They are 5 and 10, so there are two multiples of 5 in 10!. There are 10 total numbers being multiplied together in 10! and we encounter a multiple of 5 every 5 numbers. So, in 10 numbers, we encounter 2 multiples of 5.

So, for every multiple of 5 in n!, we know we have a factor of 5 (which means we have a factor of 10 and the number of factors of 10 is the number of zeroes at the end of n!). So, using a variable to store the count of factors of 5, we can use the equation above and add n / 5 to our count.

But we're not done yet. We need to be sure to count the additional 5s hiding in numbers like 25, 625, 5^4, 5^5, etc. These numbers are multiples of 5, so they've already been counted once, but they contain additional factors of 5 that need to be counted again. 25 has one more factor of 5. 625 has two more. 5^4 has three more, etc.

To handle the additional factors of 5 the multiples of 25 contribute, we can just add the number of multiples of 25 to our count. They were already counted once when we added the number of multiples of 5 to our count. That took care of their first factor of 5. Counting them once again takes cares of their second factor of 5. To do this, we can use the equation for calculating the number of multiples of a number in n! again, adding n / 25 to our count.

The same needs to be done for multiples of 625. They have a total of three factors of 5. The first was counted when we counted the number of multiples of 5. The second was counted when we counted the number of multiples of 25 (multiples of 625 are also multiples of 25). We can count the third by counting the number of multiples of 625. So, count += n / 625.

We can stop counting when we reach the point where we're not getting back any multiples. For example, 10! doesn't have any multiples of 25, much less 625. So, we can stop counting once our calculation for the number of multiples returns 0 (i.e. the denominator is so large that the calculation results in a number less than 1).

The way to grow the denominator from 5 to 25 to 625 and on is to just keep dividing by 5. After all, n / 25 = (n / 5) / 5. And the local count of the multiples for the current power of 5 can be elegantly reused in our algorithm as the value which we divide by 5 again to calculate the number of multiples of the next power of 5.

```java
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
       int m=0;
        while(n>0)
        {
            m+=n/5;
            n=n/5;
        }
        return m;
    }
}
```
